# Options_Heatmap_Pricing
This is a simple application which uses Black-Scholes Model, Binomial Tree Model, and Monte Carlo Simulations to price call and put options. It calculates standard deviations to predict volatility of a stock. A heatmap displays the volatility vs spot price of the stock, at the same exercise price, showing how key of a factor volatility of a function is.
